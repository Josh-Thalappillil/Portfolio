      <p> I majored in Health Information Management and Health Sciences before I chose <br/> 
      to pursue this path to become a software dev. Before this I always considered <br/> 
      computer science as I loved using computers in my childhood. While working as <br/>
      a Health Information Manager after graduation, the work was not as stimulating <br/>
      as I wanted although, I worked with data manipulation using python scripts which <br/>
      I really enjoyed which then brought me to discover my passion for software. <br/>
      I was indulged in the idea of the use of software to aid daily life. For example, <br/>
      MySpace, the idea that people can now be instantly connected with friends and <br/>
      family from all over the world and communicate only requiring an internet connection <br/>
      as apposed to old traditions before social media. This benefited the world immensely. <br/>
      From this I decided to learn to program.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Starting off on code academy I found it very difficult at first but after much resilence <br/> 
      I began to really enjoy coding as I like to take on challenges and solve problems. <br/>
      From code academy I developed a basic understanding of computer science expanding <br/>
      my knowledge to be able to learn from more challenging sources. From this I decided <br/>
      to start reading “The self taught programmer” by Cory Althoff, I learnt how to <br/>
      use GitHub from YouTube to be able to start uploading my learning journey, and <br/>
      decided to take on a big project, this website. My understanding of react is <br/>
      limited however, with my basic understanding of software I was able to follow and <br/> 
      learn from tutorials. This experience was a big step forward from my knowledge as <br/>
      I wasn't able to understand very complex concepts. However, this sparked extra <br/>
      motivation for me to keep building upon my knowledge. <br/>
      <br/>
      I am extremely passionate about software and I continuously strive to increase  <br/>
      my knowledge and learn new technologies to further my skills as an aspiring software developer.</p>
