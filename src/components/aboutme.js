      <p>
        My journey into software development started after completing a degree in Health<br/> 
        Information Management and Health Sciences. Though I worked briefly in the hospital, the<br/> 
        work did not challenge me enough, and I started looking for something more engaging.<br/> 
        During my degree, I had an introduction to SQL, which piqued my interest in software<br/> 
        development. After leaving my job, I began my journey into software development by gaining<br/>
        an understanding of Python through the book, "The Self-Taught Programmer"<br/> 
        by Corey Althoff and challenged myself daily by completing Codewars challenges. Eventually,<br/> 
        I moved on to The Odin Project, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, as a<br/> 
        Graduate Software Engineer at Datacom, I'm expanding my knowledge by working in the<br/> 
        .NET environment, specifically with C#. I have also begun completing small projects in C# as<br/>
        seen on my GitHub. I have completed these projects whilst practicing Object Oriented Programming<br/>
        to further enhance my skills as a developer. My ultimate goal is to work in the product<br/> 
        development life cycle, so I continue to seek new opportunities to further my skills.<br/> 
        Software development is my passion, and I'm committed to continuously learning and<br/> 
        increasing my knowledge to become a better developer.
